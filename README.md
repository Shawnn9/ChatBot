## Introduction

This chatbot is a simple conversational agent built using **Python**. It can interact with users, answer a variety of questions, tell jokes, and provide real-time data like weather information. To ensure that the knowledge base (questions and answers) is protected, it is stored in an encrypted format, which is decrypted during runtime.

### Key Features:
- **General Knowledge**: The bot can answer a wide range of factual questions.
- **Entertainment**: It can tell jokes, provide fun facts, and trivia.
- **Google Search**: If the bot doesn't know the answer, it performs a Google search.
- **Encrypted Knowledge Base**: The questions and answers are encrypted for security, ensuring no unauthorized access.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The bot can analyze sentiment and respond based on whether the user is happy, sad, or neutral.

## Features

- **General Knowledge**: The bot can answer questions on topics like science, history, geography, and more.
- **Entertainment**: The bot provides jokes, fun facts, and trivia to keep the conversation lively.
- **Google Search**: If the bot doesn't know the answer, it will search Google and provide relevant results.
- **Encrypted Data**: The knowledge base is securely encrypted using the `cryptography` library, ensuring that no one can access it without the decryption key.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using **TextBlob**, the bot analyzes the sentiment of the user's message and responds accordingly (e.g., happy, sad).
