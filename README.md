## üåü **Introduction**

Welcome to the **ChatBot** project! This chatbot is a simple conversational agent built using **Python**. It can interact with users, answer a variety of questions, tell jokes, provide real-time weather information, and more. The knowledge base (questions and answers) is stored in an encrypted format for security, and the bot decrypts the data at runtime to provide relevant responses.

### üí° **Key Features**:
- **General Knowledge**: Answers questions about science, history, geography, and more.
- **Entertainment**: Provides fun facts, jokes, and trivia.
- **Encrypted Data**: Knowledge base is securely encrypted using `cryptography`.
- **Google Search**: Performs Google search if the bot doesn't know the answer.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment and responds based on whether the user is happy, sad, or neutral.
